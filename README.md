## Project Scenario:

An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world. I'm tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
